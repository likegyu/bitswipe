            "q2_question": "Q2. Will it help with real trading?",
            "q2_answer": "Yes, it helps develop your ability to read charts and make quick decisions. However, real trading has variables that don't exist in the game, like psychological pressure, fees, and slippage. So Bitswipe can't replace real trading completely.",
            "q3_question": "Q3. Is it more fun with high leverage?",
            "q3_answer": "It's a double-edged sword! Profits are amplified but so are losses, and your chance of Liquidation (Game Over) increases. We recommend starting with low leverage (1x-5x).",
            "q4_question": "Q4. Is the candle data real Bitcoin data?",
            "q4_answer": "Yes, we use actual historical Bitcoin price data. When and which segment appears is random, so you'll have a new experience each time.",
            "q5_question": "Q5. Do I have to use indicators?",
            "q5_answer": "Not required. You can enjoy the game just by looking at the candle shapes. But learning indicators like RSI, Moving Average, and Bollinger Bands will help a lot in real trading.",
            "q6_question": "Q6. Can I compete with friends?",
